ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights & Recommendations
Production Surge since 2016: Exponential growth peaking in 2020 suggests scaling infrastructure and forecasting models.

Genre Gaps: Dramas and Comedies dominate; invest in Kidsâ€™ and Documentary content in high-growth regions.

Regional Expansion: United States, India, UK lead production; tailor content for markets like Spain and Pakistan.

Optimal Release Windows: 70% of movies drop in Q4â€”consider balancing TV-show releases in Q2 to maintain viewer engagement year-round.

Director Partnerships: Collaborate with high-output creators (e.g., Rajiv Chilaka for Kidsâ€™ shows; Martin Scorsese for prestige films).
